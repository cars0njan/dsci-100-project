    "## Background infomation on the topic\n",
    "The project focuses on data from a MineCraft research server set up by UBC Computer Science. The server records player actions, and the goal is to address practical challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Player Recruitment: Identifying which types of players contribute the most data to target recruitment effectively.\n",
    "2. Resource Allocation: Predicting player activity to manage server resources like hardware and licenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main question is: “Which kinds of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a Jupyter Notebook, the project will clean data, explore patterns, build predictive models, and document results for actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Posted question\n",
    "We choose the first question: We would like to know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.\n",
